 Stock Market Portfolio Optimization
This project focuses on optimizing a stock portfolio using historical market data. By fetching stock price data through the yfinance API, the project applies modern portfolio optimization techniques to balance risk and return.

Project Overview
Stock market investments can be risky, but with proper optimization techniques, it's possible to minimize risk while aiming for maximum returns. This project applies portfolio optimization techniques to historical stock data, helping investors create a well-balanced portfolio.

 Key Objectives:
Data Extraction: Fetch historical stock price data using the yfinance API.
Portfolio Optimization: Apply financial models, such as Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), to optimize the asset allocation based on expected returns and risk (volatility).
Risk-Return Tradeoff: Visualize the efficient frontier, showcasing the best portfolios offering the highest return for a given level of risk.
 Techniques & Tools
1. Data Extraction
yfinance: The project retrieves historical stock data from Yahoo Finance for a defined period. This data includes daily stock prices, which serve as the foundation for the optimization process.
2. Portfolio Optimization
Markowitz Modern Portfolio Theory: The project likely uses the mean-variance optimization approach, introduced by Harry Markowitz, to balance the trade-off between risk and return. By calculating the expected returns and the covariance of the stock returns, the model identifies the optimal asset allocation.
Efficient Frontier: The optimal portfolios are plotted on an efficient frontier, helping investors choose the best portfolio based on their risk tolerance.
3. Risk Management
Minimizing Volatility: The project minimizes the overall risk of the portfolio by calculating the volatility (standard deviation) of returns.
Maximizing Sharpe Ratio: The optimization aims to maximize the Sharpe ratio, which measures the return per unit of risk.
 Data Insights
Optimal Asset Allocation: The project provides insights into how to allocate assets to achieve the highest return for a given level of risk.
Efficient Frontier: The efficient frontier helps visualize the set of optimal portfolios and assists in making informed investment decisions.
Libraries & Frameworks
yfinance: For fetching stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: To handle numerical calculations, such as calculating expected returns and covariances.
Matplotlib: For plotting the efficient frontier and visualizing the optimal portfolios.
ðŸ“ˆ Results
The project produces an optimized portfolio that balances risk and return, helping investors make informed decisions about asset allocation.
The efficient frontier plot visually demonstrates the trade-off between risk and return, highlighting the optimal portfolios.
